## Introduction

Welcome to the **Text Summarizer** repository! This project is designed to provide concise summaries of lengthy text documents using state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It leverages a variety of modern frameworks and libraries to ensure high accuracy and efficiency.

## Features

- Summarizes large text documents into shorter, concise versions.
- Supports multiple languages.
- Easy integration with other applications via an API.

## Tech Stack

### Frameworks and Libraries

- **Google Colab**: An interactive notebook environment that allows you to write and execute Python code in your browser, making it ideal for developing and testing machine learning models.
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for this project. Python is known for its simplicity and readability, making it a popular choice for machine learning and NLP tasks.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: A library that provides general-purpose architectures for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG) with pre-trained models like BERT, GPT, T5, and more.
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: A suite of libraries and programs for symbolic and statistical natural language processing for English. It helps in preprocessing text data (tokenization, stemming, etc.).
- **SpaCy**: An open-source software library for advanced NLP in Python. It is designed specifically for production use and helps in preprocessing text data (tokenization, named entity recognition, etc.).


## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text-summarizer.git
    cd text-summarizer
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To use the text summarizer, follow these steps:

1. Open the `Text_Summarizer.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.

2. Run the cells in the notebook to load the necessary libraries and pre-trained models.

3. Input the text you want to summarize.

4. Execute the summarization function to get the summary.

Example:
```python
from summarizer import Summarizer

text = "Your lengthy text goes here..."
model = Summarizer()
summary = model(text)
print(summary)
```
